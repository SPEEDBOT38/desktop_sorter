# File Sorter

A simple GUI application built with Python and Tkinter that sorts files in a directory based on their extensions.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Sorts files into folders based on their extensions
- Progress bar to show sorting progress
- Status updates during the sorting process

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SPEEDBOT38/desktop_sorter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd desktop_sorter
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python sorter.py
   ```
2. Click the "Browse" button to select a directory you want to sort.
3. Click the "Sort Files" button to begin the sorting process.
